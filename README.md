photocopier
===========

A very simple project aimed to run on a raspberry pi.

The raspberry pi should be connected to an sdcard and a hard drive (through USB ?). It should also
be connected to a HD44780 screen through GPIO to display some messages.

The goal is to copy the content of the sdcard to the had drive.
